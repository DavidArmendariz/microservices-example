# Microservices example

This is a repo intended to show an app built with microservices.

Here you will find:

- The React client
- A posts microservice
- A comments microservice
- A very simple event bus to handle asynchronous communication
- A query microservice that will have all the information of posts and comments joined together

To run everything at the same time, first run `yarn install` and then:

```zsh
yarn start:all
```
