# Microservices example

This is a repo intended to show an app built with microservices.

Here you will find:

- The React client
- A posts microservice
- A comments microservice
- A very simple event bus to handle asynchronous communication
- A query microservice that will have all the information of posts and comments joined together
- A moderation microservice that moderates comments

To get started, run these three commands:

```zsh
yarn install
yarn install:all
yarn start:all
```
