# Microservices example

This is a repo intended to show an app built with microservices.

Here you will find:

- The client (built with React)
- A posts microservice (built with Express)
- A comments microservice (built with Express)
- An very simple event bus to handle asynchronous communication

To run everything at the same time, first run `yarn install` and then:

```zsh
yarn start:all
```
